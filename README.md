# FirestoreCafe

It's a simple project that i'm making by following shaun's firestore tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d-gIPGzmK4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB&index=1&ab_channel=TheNetNinja. <br>
He made it with javascript but i'm triying with TypeScript. <br>
Compiling with: <i> npm run build</i>
